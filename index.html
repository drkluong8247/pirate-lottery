<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Sail the seas to protect the treasure you won from pirates and other marine threats.
</li>

</li>

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
A basic side-scrolling game with enemies that you can take on and things to avoid completely.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Instead of including powerups, the player starts with a series of "bomb" skills with varying cooldowns. The player can use them to aid in various situations.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
This game is set in a world similar to the one depicted in One Piece, with pirates roaming the sea and mythical creatures that wouldn't normally occur in normal life.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
You got yourself a lottery ticket a week ago, and now you've won the lottery! In your boat, you sail to the lottery building to pick up your prize.... a vast amount of gold and other treasure! But on your way home, you notice something on the horizon. It appears to be approaching your ship, but you don't worry about it. As it comes closer, you do begin to worry as you realize that you're about to confront... pirates. 
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
This is meant for people who like to play side-scrolling shooter games.
</li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
Potentially infinite time, depending on how the player plays.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Don't stay too close to the right of the screen. Pirates might ram your ship and rob you of all you've got (the lottery grand prize). Also pay attention to the top and bottom sides of the screen. Don't pay attention, and the leviathan will swallow you whole.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
MS Paint was used to make the background, characters, attacks, and enemies from scratch.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
Borrowed from the Phaser Example - Invaders to create the enemies and player controls.
